            <p class="job_description">I have had two stints at MRI Software with the earliest starting in January 2022 as a Solutions Consultant. While in this role I had the privelage of implementing software solutions for clients. This was done individually or working with additional consultants based on the needs of the clients. Projects included writing CSS for client portals to match their existing branding and writing custom SQL queries to help transfer their forms into digital forms used within our software.</p>
            <p class="job_description">After completing a web development boot camp I was happy to accept a new position at MRI as a QA Engineer. Since March of 2023 I have been performing manual testing in our suite of products.</p>

            <p class="job_description">CutterCroix was my first full time position after finishing college and would in turn set me on the path I am on today. Initially hired as a Customer Success Representative my duties included fielding customer calls and emails related to any issues or questions someone may have had. Additionally I would get the opportunity to perform QA prior to software releases on our web and mobile applications.</p>
