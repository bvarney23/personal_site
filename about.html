                    Over this past summer I got married on July 3 at the Valley of the Eagles Golfcourse in Elyria, Ohio. The day went off without a hitch and from what I can tell, rather remember, fun was had by all.

                    When not spending time learning to be a web developer I have the joy, or pain, of being a Cleveland Browns season ticket holder. I have seen more losses than wins over the years but like the great Bobo tells me, "You go for the people you are with more than the team."

                    It wasn't a coinceidence that I had my wedding at a golf course. When the weather is nice enough in northeast Ohio I like to golf. Although a tip to everyone, swinging a golf club is not easy in your wedding clothes!
