                    I have had two stints at MRI Software with the earliest starting in January 2022 as a Solutions Consultant. While in this role I had the privelage of implementing software solutions for clients. This was done individually or working with additional consultants based on the needs of the clients. Projects included writing CSS for client portals to match their existing branding and writing custom SQL queries to help transfer their forms into digital forms used within our software.

                    When not spending time learning to be a web developer I have the joy, or pain, of being a Cleveland Browns season ticket holder. I have seen more losses than wins over the years but like the great Bobo tells me, "You go for the people you are with more than the team."

                    It wasn't a coinceidence that I had my wedding at a golf course. When the weather is nice enough in northeast Ohio I like to golf. Although a tip to everyone, swinging a golf club is not easy in your wedding clothes!
